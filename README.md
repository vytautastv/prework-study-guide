# prework-study-guide

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a study guide for making notes related to our learnings during the edX FrontEnd bootcamp on HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git.
We built a study resource that we can reference back to and use as a reminder of key learning points. 
This resource helps to keep all notes structured and easy to access whenever needed. 
Learned basics of HTML, CSS, JS, git, and GitHub as well as best practices of development workflows.
